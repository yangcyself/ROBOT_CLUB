Current Courses

- AU416 Introduction to Robotics
  Supervisor : Prof. Hesheng Wang, SJTU 
  Maintainer : Quan
  - The course is about robotics kinematics mainly on manipulator kinematics.
  - Currently the course is relatively simple.
- CVX101 Convex Optimization
  Supervisor : Prof. Boyd, Stanford
  Maintainer : Quan
  - The course is about all problems on convex optimization. Topics including quadratic programming, linear & nonlinear programming and practical problems in geometry, finance and so on. It's very useful in robotics control and kinematics. Thus I put it here too.
  - The course is really difficult especially in those hard-core mathmetics. Much of the content I cannot digest well actually. Every Friday I'll have Network Optimization class where I can ask some question about cvx to the professor there.
- ME193 Feedback control of Legged Robots
- CS285 Reinforcement Learning
