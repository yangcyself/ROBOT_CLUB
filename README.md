Current Courses

- AU416 Introduction to Robotics
  - **Supervisor** : Prof. Hesheng Wang, SJTU 
  - **Maintainer** : Quan
  - The course is about robotics kinematics mainly on manipulator kinematics.
  - Currently the course is relatively simple.
- CVX101 Convex Optimization
  - **Supervisor** : Prof. Boyd, Stanford
  - **Maintainer** : Quan
  - The course is about all problems on convex optimization. Topics including quadratic programming, linear & nonlinear programming and practical problems in geometry, finance and so on. It's very useful in robotics control and kinematics. Thus I put it here too.
  - The course is really difficult especially in those hard-core mathmetics. Much of the content I cannot digest well actually. Every Friday I'll have Network Optimization class where I can ask some question about cvx to the professor there.
- ME193 Feedback control of Legged Robots
  - **Supervisor**: Koushil Sreenath
  - this course is about the topics around designing a bipedded robot, covering from modeling the dynamics to control and stability.

- CS285 Reinforcement Learning
  - **Supervisor**: 
  - this course is about the topics in reinforcement learning. I did not enroll in this course, and I really do not have enough time and effort to keep up with the pace of this course. I just try to follow this course through its [webpage](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkFD6_40KJIwhWJpGazJ9VSj9CFMkb79A), and piazza.

- ME232 advanced control
  - **Supervisor**: 
  - this course is the graduate class about control, but now it is still dealing with linear algebra.
